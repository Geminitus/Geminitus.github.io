        </h2>
        <p>
            My name is Austin Smith and I am an aspiring young developer looking for an opportunity to work hard and continue growing my skillset at structured and inviting workplace.
            I studied coding at the Momentum Learning code boot camp and am eager to put what I've learned there to good use. Below are a few of the projects that I constructed from the ground up during my time at Momentum Learning.

            A social networking site with the goal of bringing users together to practice their skills in 
            foreign languages by speaking with other users that natively speak the language. This project was 
            primarily made using the Python framework, Django, but also uses Node.js to implement Voice and Video calling
            as well as instant messaging.

            This project was made with the goal of allowing users visiting the site to ask questions to other users
            that may have more knowledge on the topic they are asking about, similar to Yahoo Answers or Stack Overflow.
            ChunkCascade uses Django for storing users data and Javascript to construct the user facing part of the project.
